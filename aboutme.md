About me
========

Hi. I'm Rainer. I have probably moved somewhere else on the interwebs by now, [try googling me](http://google.com/?q=Rainer+Dreyer).

But since you're here, this is the gist of it(me):

* I'm German Namibian. (I.e. I was born in Namibia, raised German in Namibia & 
  Germany, but feel proudly African.)

* I like writing python, but I've also been taught Java, C, C++ and a little 
  Objective C & C#. At the moment I'm exploring JavaScript / CoffeeScript (node & 
  express & zappa) and Haskell (maybe yesod).

* As you can see I'm no designer, so don't ask me to make anything pretty.

* I eat and drink anything and especially like sushi and Namibian beer. 
  Actually, I'll have a Windhoek right now, since I'm out of Tafel. Hmm, not bad.

My team mates describe me as the chilled one, [Rickert](~rmulder) describes me as overly agreeable. He's probably right.

Next year (2012) I am going to Johannesburg to work for [S1](http://s1.com). My girlfriend stayed in Cape Town for me for an extra 2 years after her degree, so I'll bite the bullet (and be open minded) and go live in JHB for at least a year.
