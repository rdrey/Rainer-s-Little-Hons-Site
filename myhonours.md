My Honours
==========

I did the following honours modules:

* Research Methods
* New Venture Planning
* Mobile Interaction Design
* Network & Internet Security
* User Experience in Games and Virtual Environments
* World Wide Web Technology
* Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks
* Massively Parallel Computing with Graphical Processing Units
* iPhone Game Development
* Visual Thinking
* ICT for Development 

I enjoyed all of them, and might one day write up detailed descriptions for each one.

I created my own thesis topic in 2010 and found [James Gain](~jgain) to supervise it and [Lawrence](~lwebley) and [Rizmari](~rversfeld) as great team mates.

The result can be found on [project](~lwebley). A quick outline can be found on [thesis](thesis.html).
