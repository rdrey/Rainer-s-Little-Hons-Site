About this site
===============

We were not allowed to use any server-side scripting, which eliminated the potential use of Django/Pyramid/flask, express, yesod or any other cool tech.

This site was built using: 

* markdown
  To write the content. (Misusing it completely by not generating real html from 
  its markup.)

* vim
  To use :TOhtml for marked-up markdown, silly I know.

* sublime text 2
  The editor that the hacking is happening in and that served as visual 
  inspiration for the tabbed layout.

* css and javascript
  To generate line numbers dynamically. CSS to resize the page for large screens.

* python
  To write a silly little script that takes a frame.html file, replaces a `<pre>` 
  element with content generated by vim, then regexes over it and dynamically 
  generates links and images in the output.html.

Here are the [silly script](builder.py) and [frame.html](frame.html), so you can check them out. If I wasn't trying to go for this crazy look, I would have used something more sensible, such as blogofile, Jekyll or Octopress, to generate these static pages.
